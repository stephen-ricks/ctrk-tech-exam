# Simple CRUD Exercise

On this project, I only use the employee table to demonstrate the CRUD actions via API endpoints.

Requirements:
1. Lumen 5.3 dependencies (https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/installation#server-requirements)
2. pgsql php extension
3. composer https://getcomposer.org/

To run this application:

```
bash run.sh
```

the database connection settings is on `.env` file

The sample postman collection is included in this repositiory. https://github.com/stephen-ricks/ctrk-tech-exam/blob/main/Employee%20CRUD%20Endpoints.postman_collection.json
